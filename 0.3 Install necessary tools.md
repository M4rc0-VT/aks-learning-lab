Let's turn your home laptop into a cloud command center. Since you are on a "home laptop," I will assume **Windows**, but I have included Mac commands just in case.

### **Phase 1: Install the Azure CLI (`az`)**

This is the tool that lets you talk to the Azure Cloud (create resources, stop billing, etc.).

**For Windows (Easiest Way - Winget):**
Open your **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and run:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Microsoft.AzureCLI
```

*(If you don't have Winget, download the [official installer (MSI) here](https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows). When you install a new tool via the command line, the "Path" often doesn't update in the window you already have open. After the installation completes, restart the **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**)*

**For Mac (Homebrew):**

```bash
brew update && brew install azure-cli
```

**Verify it works:**
Close your terminal and open a new one. Type:

```bash
az version
```

(You should see a JSON list of versions.)

### **Phase 2: Install Kubernetes Tool (`kubectl`)**

This is the tool that lets you talk *inside* the cluster (deploy pods, check logs).

**The "Expert" Shortcut:**
Since you just installed the Azure CLI, you can actually use *it* to install `kubectl` for you\!

1.  Open your terminal (run as **Administrator** on Windows).
2.  Run this command:
    ```bash
    az aks install-cli
    ```
3.  **Critical Step for Windows:** You might need to add the folder it created (usually `C:\Users\<YourUser>\.azure-kubectl`) to your system **PATH**.
      * *Easier Alternative if that sounds complex:* Just run `winget install -e --id Kubernetes.kubectl`.

**Verify it works:**

```bash
kubectl version --client
```

-----

### **Phase 3: Connect and "Stop" (The Final Check)**

Now that you have the tools, let's link them to the cluster you created.

1.  **Login to Azure:**

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

    (A browser window will pop up. Sign in with your Azure account.)

2.  **Download the Keys:**

    ```bash
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group rg-learning-aks --name <your-cluster-name>
    ```

3.  **Test the Connection:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    (If it says "Ready," you are successful\! Note: This command will only work if the cluster is running)

4.  **Practice the "Stop" Command:**
    Even if you stopped it in the Portal earlier, run this to be sure:

    ```bash
    az aks stop --name <your-cluster-name> --resource-group rg-learning-aks
    ```
