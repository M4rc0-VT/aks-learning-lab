This is the most important "Cloud Native" skill to learn first: **Cost Management (FinOps)**. In the cloud, you pay for *capacity*, not just usage.

If you are careful, this will cost you **less than $15/month**.
If you are careless, it can cost **$60/month or more**.

Here is the breakdown for a minimal "Expert Track" cluster (1 Node, Standard B2s size, East US region):

### 1. The Variable Costs (You pay only when it is "On")
These are the costs that stop when you run `az aks stop`.

| Resource | Role | Cost (Approx) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Virtual Machine** | The worker node (CPU/RAM) | **$0.05 / hour** |
| **Load Balancer** | Handles network traffic | **$0.025 / hour** |
| **Public IP** | Allows internet access | **$0.004 / hour** |
| **Total "Running" Cost** | | **~$0.08 / hour** |

### 2. The Fixed Costs (You pay even if it is "Off")
These persist until you strictly **delete** the cluster or the specific disk.

| Resource | Role | Cost (Approx) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Managed Disk (32GB)** | The Node's Hard Drive | **~$2.50 / month** |

### The "Learner's Budget" Scenarios

* **Scenario A: The "Forgot to Turn it Off" (24/7)**
    * 730 hours x $0.08 = $58.40
    * + $2.50 Disk
    * **Total: ~$61 / month** (Ouch!)

* **Scenario B: The "Weekend Warrior" (15 hours/week)**
    * 60 hours x $0.08 = $4.80
    * + $2.50 Disk
    * **Total: ~$7.30 / month** (Very affordable)

Since the first 30 days are covered by your $200 credit, we have a "safe zone" to set up automation that stops the cluster automatically at night.

When we write your infrastructure in Terraform or Bicep, we are defining the *desired state*.
* **To "Stop" (Save money):** We might run a script that scales the cluster to 0 nodes or stops the VM.
* **To "Destroy" (Save more money):** We run `terraform destroy`. The definition (code) remains safe on your computer. When you want it back, you run `terraform apply`, and 10 minutes later, your cloud data center is back online.

**The One Catch: Data Gravity** ⚠️
Compute (the CPU/RAM) is easy to destroy and recreate. **Data** is not.
If you destroy your cluster, you also destroy the "hard drives" (Persistent Volumes) attached to it.
* **The Lesson:** We will learn to separate **Compute** (AKS) from **State** (Databases, Azure SQL, Storage Accounts). This ensures you can burn down the cluster without losing your data.
