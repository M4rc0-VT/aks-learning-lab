This mix creates a very strong profile—essentially a **Lead Platform Engineer**. You are prioritizing the *automation and systems* that enable others (50%), supported by solid *architectural design* (40%), with just enough *security awareness* to keep things safe (10%).

This is a highly sought-after skillset because it moves beyond "making Kubernetes work" to "making Kubernetes workable for the enterprise."

Here is a high-level syllabus to get you to expert level in 12 months.

### **The Syllabus: Year of the Platform Architect**

| Quarter | Theme | Key Topics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q1** | **The Architectural Foundation** (40% focus) | • Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Bicep)<br>• AKS Networking (CNI, VNETs, Private Link)<br>• Cluster lifecycle management |
| **Q2** | **The GitOps Engine** (50% focus) | • GitOps principles (ArgoCD or Flux)<br>• Advanced Helm (Library charts, dependencies)<br>• Kustomize for environment overlays |
| **Q3** | **Observability & Developer Experience** (50% focus) | • Prometheus/Grafana vs. Azure Monitor<br>• Ingress Controllers & Service Mesh basics<br>• Building "Golden Path" templates for devs |
| **Q4** | **Governance & Hardening** (10% focus) | • Workload Identity (No more secrets\!)<br>• Azure Policy for Kubernetes<br>• Supply chain security (Image signing) |

### **Quarter 1: The Architectural Foundation**
**Mission:** Build a production-grade AKS cluster, first manually (to understand the architecture), and then automate it with Terraform.

We are going to start by creating your **"Reference Cluster"** in the Azure Portal. We will pick specific settings that mimic a real enterprise environment (like the one at your work) rather than the default "Sandbox" settings.
